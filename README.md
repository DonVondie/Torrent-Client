Torrent-Client
==============

This is a project started by Paul Jones, Richie VonderSchmidt, and myself during the summer of 2013 while taking the CS352 (Internet Technology) at Rutgers University. This client implements the BitTorrent protocol as shown here

BitTorrenting is a peer to peer file distribution system and you can read more information on it here

As of 12/11/2013 the client can only handle one torrent file at a time but that will be adjusted soon. There are also some bugs with implementing the protocol, most specifically peer-to-peer communication as well as tracker communication. There are also design flaws which will be plucked out soon.

Main Goal
==============

The main goal of this project is to eventually turn it into a fully-functioning, bug-free and efficient open-source torrent client with a smooth user-friendly interface. At this point it is far from that but we have to start somewhere!
